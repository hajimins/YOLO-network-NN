## **YOLO Object Detection Network**

This repository implements the YOLO architecture for object detection, supporting batch processing and CUDA acceleration. The model is trained on the **Pascal VOC Dataset**, which contains annotated images for detecting multiple object classes.

### **Dataset Reference**
The pretrained weights and class labels are based on the **Pascal VOC Dataset**, a widely used benchmark for object detection, classification, and segmentation tasks.
