YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection Implementation
This project is a custom implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, a popular object detection framework. YOLO uses a single convolutional neural network to detect and classify objects in real-time, making it a fast and efficient solution for object detection tasks.

Through this project, we aim to:

Understand the YOLO architecture and its unique one-stage approach.
Implement the model and its components from scratch using PyTorch.
Train the model on a subset of a benchmark object detection dataset (e.g., COCO or Pascal VOC).
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using standard metrics like mAP and IoU.
